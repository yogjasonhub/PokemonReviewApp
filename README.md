# PokemonReviewApp

Currently creating a Pokemon review system application by following a tutorial by Teddy Smith who is a .NET developer and helps guide .NET beginners into the .NET framework with Web API. Once finished I plan to attend and take his .NET MVC tutorial/guide to keep furthering my knowledge down the .NET path.
